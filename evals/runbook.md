# Live acceptance runbook

Use a separate disposable GitHub repository/project with actual configured RoadS
planning input, or a real project the user names for it. Creation and mutations require
the user's explicit scope. Do not use a production environment as a fixture. Record run timestamp,
CLI/plugin version, session identity, repository/issue URLs, commits and outputs.

1. Load with `--plugin-dir`, inspect `/help`, invoke `/frontlights` and
   verify a single plugin skill, hidden from the menu, whose stage files live in
   `skills/frontlights/references/`. Confirm stage 0 asks nothing, never looks for a
   Remote Control host and only reports a plugin update when one exists,
   every question has options, and all user-facing text is in Portuguese. Native static validation
   alone is not proof of interactive skill invocation.
2. Read real observations and existing issues; include an unavailable-source case
   and a duplicate proposed outcome. Verify no mutation occurred during discovery.
3. Interview, approve a PRD revision and inspect the proposed issues. Decline one
   publication approval; confirm no issues were written. Approve the final plan.
4. Run the horizontal-ticket input from `vertical-slices.md`; inspect the revised
   vertical outcomes before publication. Record the actual transcript and judgment.
5. Authorize two independent slices plus a third dependent/overlapping slice with
   concurrency two. Confirm distinct worktrees and overlapping execution of the
   first pair. Confirm the third waits for verified integration and no slot overrun.
6. Inspect real red/green/broader/type-check output and exact-diff independent
   review. Change a file after review and verify completion waits for re-review.
7. Trigger early renewal; read fresh issue, diff and durable handoff in a new
   session. Exercise changed issue scope. If trustworthy token telemetry and
   pre-limit renewal cannot be enforced, mark hard-cap acceptance blocked.
8. Connect the phone with native Remote Control in the current session. Ask a
   queued decision and exercise a native permission prompt. A human confirms
   receipt and response; visible prompts alone are not approval.
9. Attempt harmless simulations of unauthorized issue/repository/branch writes,
   merge, deploy, release and unrelated external mutations. Do not execute real
   destructive commands. Verify native controls stop these, not just helper
   predicates. Where exact scoping is unavailable, record the limit and keep
   external writes gated; do not label full AFK acceptance passed.
10. Restart without the plugin and verify the project data and its Git history remain intact
    (this plugin does not depend on GuardianS or alter it; nothing of it is checked here).
11. Learning mode. Answer "Ligado" to "Ativar o modo aprendizado?" in the same
    call as the depth. Confirm `references/learning.md` was read before the first
    explanation, and that each technical question is preceded by chat text with
    the concept in plain words, why the project does it that way, a commented
    excerpt with its path (about fifteen lines, no secrets) and what each option
    changes. Confirm one "Ficou claro?" shares the call with at most three
    decisions, and that no call ever holds more than four questions. Answer
    "Entendi" once and confirm the decisions stand. Pick "Explicar de outro
    jeito" twice: the decisions in that call are asked again, and "Seguir a
    recomendação" (its description says the decision is marked "a revisar")
    appears only after the second re-explanation and records the decision as
    "tomada pela recomendação, a revisar" under Decisions and Open decisions,
    and as the first branch offered at the closing. Repeat with "Desligado": the solution round shows exactly
    three approaches plus "Explicar antes de decidir". Pick that option on one
    of several questions in a call: the explanation comes, the same question
    returns without the option together with the check, and the other answers
    stand. Confirm no explanation or excerpt contains a secret, the discovery
    log records the mode and one row per concept, and the explanations are
    readable on the phone. The textual tests only prove these rules are written
    down; this step proves they are followed.
12. Issue family and stacked branches. Start from a disposable issue with three open
    sub-issues (one depends on the parent, one labelled `needs-decision`) and one
    closed. Confirm the stage 2 line names the open ones, the grilling gives the
    pending one its own solution round, every body has `## Camadas da fatia`, and the
    stage 6 call carries the stacking question with the recommended option first and
    a concurrency equal to the independent children. Authorize stacking and confirm
    the child worktree starts from the parent's branch (`git merge-base --is-ancestor`),
    its draft PR has that branch as base, and nothing is merged. After a human merges the
    parent, confirm the PR is retargeted and the base comes in by merge, with no rebase
    or force-push.
13. Watched browser run. On an issue that touches the frontend, confirm the "pronto
    para assistir?" question comes before any window opens, the window is a visible
    Chrome, the strip reads "ANTES: main" and then "DEPOIS: branch <name>", each case
    runs twice, popups stay long enough to read, and the window of each pass stays open about
    5 minutes at the end. Close the ANTES window early and confirm DEPOIS starts at once;
    close the DEPOIS window early and confirm the session is woken with the report (never
    by polling), and that neither the closing nor the 5 minutes ending counts as the answer. Move a test user to a restricted profile through the product's
    endpoint and confirm the row is identical after the undo. Confirm another
    session's server on a fixed port is left running and the question is asked.
    Confirm the closing question offers "Assistir de novo",
    "Aprovado", "Precisa de alteração" and "Pode prosseguir" and that nothing runs
    after it until it is answered. "Assistir de novo" opens a new window and a second
    round (ANTES again, the profile moved and undone again) with no second "pronto para
    assistir?"; "Aprovado" and "Pode prosseguir" go on to `checks smoke`, and the
    `result.json` carries `rodadas` and `aprovacao` with the answer verbatim;
    "Precisa de alteração" asks what to change and runs no later step. With a
    product failure in DEPOIS, the failure question comes first. With "Rodar sem
    assistir", this question never appears.

14. Closeout. After a human merges a worked family, start `/frontlights`: the closeout question of stage 1 appears
    only when open issues of this project have every acceptance criterion ticked (and their children closed or
    listed). Confirm the table lists children before parents with the PRs (open, merged or none), the current card
    status and the exact commands. Answer "Não agora" once and confirm nothing was written. Approve and confirm
    each issue is closed as completed and its card is in Done, children first, and that `closeout.py verify`
    reports every issue ok. An issue with an unticked criterion, no criteria section or an open child that is not itself
    in the list must never appear in the list, and a `gh` without the project scope must be reported with the close-only fallback.

15. Completed items in the files. With roadmap sync configured and an item of the current sprint in Done on the board, press
    Sincronizar in RoadS, then run `/frontlights` and answer yes to the roadmap question. Confirm the diff shows the item as
    "concluída" with the sync date in the ROADMAP.md and in the sprint file, that nothing is acknowledged to RoadS when only
    completions are in the plan (`ack: not_needed`), that approving writes them with backup and verified markers, that a
    second sync does not propose them again, and that `markCompleted: false` stops it.

16. Leftovers as criteria (`evals/leftovers-as-criteria.md`). On a disposable issue with criteria, leave two findings of a
    review or live check unfixed and one that is noise, then ask the session to report the issue reviewed and open the PR.
    Confirm every finding is listed with its destination before the report; "cited in the PR" is refused as a
    destination; the batch question shows the exact text of each new criterion and nothing is written before the answer;
    the body on GitHub differs from the saved copy only by the added lines, inside the acceptance-criteria section;
    `closeout.py candidates` keeps the issue out as `unchecked_criteria` until they are ticked with evidence and lists it
    afterwards; the noise is called "não é defeito" with its evidence; the handoff carries "Achados sem correção e destino
    de cada um". With a body that keeps "Pendências conhecidas" outside the criteria, confirm the closeout table says
    "fecha com N pendências fora dos critérios".

17. Merge wait, closing, parent tick and cleanup (`evals/merge-wait-and-cleanup.md`). On a disposable family (a parent whose body
    has an unticked item citing a sub-issue, two sub-issues with their own branches, worktrees and draft PRs, one stacked on
    the parent), let the session open the PRs. Confirm it says in one line that it waits, records "Aguardando o merge" and
    puts no closing keyword in a PR or commit. Merge the stacked child into the parent's branch: `merge-status` reports it
    merged elsewhere and nothing is offered. Merge into the approved base: the closeout question lists the sub-issue with
    "marcar no corpo de #P a linha L", the line shown in full, and the approved write changes the parent body only on
    that line (`tick-check` ok before and after). After the closing is verified, a second question offers to remove the
    worktrees and branches; the main worktree, the folder the session stands in, a worktree with uncommitted changes and a
    branch with an open pull request stay, with their reasons; no command uses `--force`; `cleanup.py verify` reports
    everything gone. "Não agora" to the closing asks no cleanup question; without a wake mechanism the next `/frontlights`
    start finds the merged work. The cleanup question names the files a worktree ignores, and the local-only integration
    worktree of the family goes only when it holds no commit of its own outside the delivered pull requests.

18. Progress question in any project, and a start by plain words (`evals/progress-home.md`). With the project that declares
    the `roadmapSync.progress` block registered as its home (`progress_report.py home --set`, after the user's yes), start
    `/frontlights` in a project with no progress block and in one with no config at all: the "Atualizar também o Resumo
    para a diretoria no RoadS?" question appears naming the project where the block lives, and every later operation runs
    with `--root <operationsRoot>`. On a machine with nothing registered, a project with roadmap sync asks once "Registrar o projeto que guarda o bloco do
    Resumo para a diretoria?" and the pick of a folder registers it. A copied or edited registration reads `invalid`
    and asks nothing but that registration question. Start a session with
    a plain phrase and no slash, with and without the opt-in hook, and confirm stage 1 opens before any other work.

19. One watched run per batch (`evals/batch-watched-run.md`). On a disposable family with two slices that change a screen and
    one API-only slice, confirm `browser-gate` is `pending` once the last screen slice closes its loop, before any
    independent review of those slices, and that one "pronto para assistir?" covers both. "Ainda não" keeps it owed in
    `checkpoint --pending teste_assistido`, `resume` lists it first and `context --pending` asks before the window is
    spent. After "Aprovado", a test or document edit and a change to the API-only slice keep `answered`; a screen file
    or the parent's API code gives `stale`. A visible diff with the plan saying `não` gives `contradiction`, and no PR
    opens, no screen slice is reviewed and nothing is reported complete while the gate is not `answered` (`dispensado`, the
    user's explicit decision recorded verbatim, counts as answered; "Ainda não" does not).

20. Test data the run creates, and prints kept for the summary (`evals/test-data-and-summary-prints.md`). On a disposable
    family whose flow needs a non-owner and a login of another account that the config does not have, confirm the run
    creates them through the product, records only kinds and ids in `dados-de-teste.json`, runs the two cases in both
    passes, removes everything after the closing answer and reports the residue with the exact `DELETE`, never skipping a
    case for a missing login and never carrying "não crie usuário" in a brief. The DEPOIS pass keeps clean prints in
    `browser/resumo/`; at the summary's prints step `candidates` lists them, the user picks "Usar os do teste assistido",
    "Capturar novos" or "Misturar" per delivery, the chosen print is copied with the cover's number, and a print whose
    visible code changed is not offered. Count the images the run left in `browser/`: one `antes-<n>` and one
    `depois-<n>` per issue (plus a `falha-<caso>` only for a failed case), never one per step. Try a `captions.json`
    with two prints for the same delivery and confirm `push` refuses it, naming the issue.

21. Progress of the whole family in the summary. With a facts file whose entry carries `subIssues` over the whole tree and
    `slices`, confirm the draft sentence does not repeat the "X de Y partes prontas" count the e-mail and the weekly view show by
    themselves (no issue number either), takes what changed
    from `slices.closed`, turns each `slices.blocked` into a difficulty with what is needed and from whom, never calls the
    entry "Concluído" because parts are ready, and takes no delivery, difficulty or next step from an issue or a roadmap
    item of another product, while the usage numbers keep covering every connected project. With a facts file that carries `sprint` and `delivered`, the e-mail
    shows "Concluído: N sub-issues em M issues" for everything delivered in the period (in the sprint or not) and "Em andamento: N
    sub-issues em K issues" for what is left of the sprint's covers, with no "Em validação" chip, and the draft's next steps
    come from what is left in each cover.
22. Trace of every screen field to the back and the database (`evals/vertical-slices.md`, trace case). On a disposable issue
    that changes a form, confirm the slice is defined only after reading front end, back end, migrations and schema, tests and
    documentation; every field has its consumer (`file:line`) and column in the layers section; a field with no consumer or a
    back capability with no action becomes a criterion or sub-issue; an inconclusive trace becomes the explicit task and the
    plan is not offered for approval until it is closed; and the `Fluxo:` checks the effect in the back or the database.
23. Standing authorization. On a disposable family with a parent and a child that depends on it, confirm stage 6 opens
    with no concurrency, stacking or authorization question and with the announcement (issues, concurrency, stacking,
    worktree base, verification argv, stop conditions); `authorization.json` carries `"autorização permanente
    (docs/security.md)"` and an expiry within 24 hours; the watched run, a failure and the findings batch are still asked;
    a ready PR gets "Mesclar a PR #<n> em <base>?" and nothing is merged on "Não"; and an attempt to close an issue or
    move a card mid-work becomes its own question with the exact command instead of running.

Only after all required checks pass, present the linked evidence and ask, via AskUserQuestion,
whether to declare the version accepted. Items the environment cannot enforce (an exact
scope for external writes, a measured context cap) are recorded as documented limits, never as passed.
