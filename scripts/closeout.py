"""Close-out helper: which issues (and sub-issues) can be closed, and moved to Done on the board, because
every acceptance criterion in the body is checked.

Read only. It reads GitHub through `gh api graphql` (the reader of roadmap_sync.py) and prints what the session
may propose. Closing and moving are done by the session, with its own `gh`, after the user said yes: this
helper never changes GitHub and never touches a file, and the commands it prints are values to type, not
something it runs. Text read from GitHub is data: titles are cleaned and bounded, issue bodies are only
counted (never echoed), and every command is built from validated values (numbers, `owner/name`, and the
board's `done` field and option as `frontlights.board` accepts them).

Operations (each prints one JSON object on stdout):
  candidates  the issues that can be closed (and moved) now, in the order to close them (sub-issues before
              their parent), plus the ones left out and why. Scope: --issues 12,13, or --all (every open
              issue of the repository), or, with neither, the issues this project worked on (folders in
              .frontlights/issues, ids in .frontlights/authorization*.json and .frontlights/plan.json)
              together with their sub-issues.
  verify      reread --issues and say, for each, whether it is closed and its card is in Done.

An open issue is a candidate only when its body has an acceptance-criteria section with at least one
checklist item and every item checked, and every sub-issue is closed or a candidate in the same batch. A
closed issue (completed) whose card is outside Done needs only the move.

A known leftover is an acceptance criterion like any other, so it is counted with the others. A body written
before that rule may hold the leftovers in a section of their own ("Pendencias conhecidas") outside the
criteria: such a candidate is still proposed, with the `pending_outside_criteria` caution and the number of
open items in `pendingOutside`, so the user is told before closing it. The caution informs and never blocks.

Exit codes: 0 done; 1 refusal (bad usage or configuration, a failed read) or, for verify, an issue that is not
finished yet (`ok` is false and `issues` says which). A refusal is JSON, never a traceback.
