# Fixed machine in the Claude mobile app

The user runs this as `/workflows:total-remote-control` inside an interactive
`claude` session opened from PowerShell in the project folder. `/workflows` sends
them here; they may also run it directly. The goal is one thing only: this PC
appears in the Claude mobile app as a machine where the user can open sessions,
and the user has proven it by opening one from the phone.

Everything the user reads is in Brazilian Portuguese (or the user's language).
Every step ends in one `AskUserQuestion` with two to four options; never leave an
open question in prose. Every command goes in its own code block, ready to
copy, with real paths. Configure nothing silently and never start the host
yourself: a host started from your own tools dies with this session.

Be explicit about the difference, because users confuse them: following one
existing session from the phone (the desktop app's remote access, or native
`/remote-control` inside a session) is not a fixed machine. Only the host
started by `claude remote-control` in a terminal that stays open makes the
machine appear for new sessions.

## 1. Read the machine

Run `python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/workflow.py" monitoring --root .` and
tell the user, in one short paragraph, the two power values and whether a host
process exists. A missing power value reads as unknown, never as zero. No
candidate process is a safe conclusion that no host runs here. A candidate is a
process, not a connected phone.

If a candidate already exists, ask header `Host existente`: `É o meu host, seguir
para o celular` (go to step 5), `Iniciar outro host`, `Não sei` (explain how to
find the window that runs `claude remote-control`).

## 2. The two conditions

State them as requirements, in plain words, then ask two questions together:

- A janela do PowerShell que roda o host precisa ficar **aberta o tempo todo**.
  Fechar a janela encerra o host em segundos; nenhuma configuração de energia
  muda isso.
- A tampa do notebook fica **aberta** até um teste com a tampa fechada passar
  nesta máquina. O PC pode ficar bloqueado.

Header `Condições`: `Concordo`, `Não posso`. Header `Energia`, "A máquina fica na
tomada enquanto você estiver fora?": `Na tomada`, `Na bateria`, `Não sei`.
`Não posso` ends the skill: tell the user the phone can still follow a single
session, and that `/workflows` will run in local mode. Battery or unknown power
continues with the caveat that only about ninety seconds of locked survival were
ever measured, on battery; promise nothing beyond that.

## 3. Power, only when needed

Only if a measured value is not zero or is unknown: show the current values and
the exact `powercfg` lines for the active scheme and these two settings only,
with the previous values so they can be restored. The user runs them; you do
not change system settings. Ask header `Ajuste de energia`: `Vou rodar os
comandos`, `Deixar como está`. After `Vou rodar os comandos`, rerun the
preflight and report the new values. A zero lock-display value attempts to stop
lock from entering standby; it is not a proven fix. Never set sleep to "never",
never call `SetThreadExecutionState`, never touch another scheme.

## 4. Start the host in a second window

Tell the user to keep this window open and open **another** PowerShell window,
then paste, with the real folder and a short name derived from it:

```powershell
cd "<pasta do projeto>"
```

```powershell
claude remote-control --name <nome-curto>
```

Warn in one line: it is `claude remote-control`, with a space and no dash before
`remote`. `claude -remote-control` is not the host command: the single dash
turns it into short options such as `-r` (resume), which was observed to open a
list of old sessions instead of starting a host. Keep `--spawn`, `--capacity` and
`--permission-mode` at their defaults; never suggest `bypassPermissions`,
`acceptEdits`, `auto` or `dontAsk`.

Ask header `Host`: `A janela mostra o host ativo`, `Apareceu uma lista de
sessões`, `Deu erro ou a janela fechou`.

- List of sessions: explain the one-dash cause, tell them to leave it with `Esc`,
  and repeat this step.
- Error: offer the known causes as options — `Não estou logado` (run `claude`,
  then `/login`, in that window), `Pediu para confiar na pasta` (run `claude`
  once in the folder, accept, `/exit`, then the host command), `Outro erro`
  (paste it in the free-text choice). Repeat this step afterwards.

## 5. Confirm the host exists

Rerun the preflight. With no candidate process, say plainly that the host is not
running on this machine, whatever the window seems to show, and return to step
4 with header `Host`: `Tentar de novo`, `Ficar no modo local`. Never continue to
the phone without a detected process.

## 6. Pin it on the phone

Tell the user: no app Claude do celular, entre na área de código (Code), procure a
máquina `<nome-curto>` na lista de ambientes ou sessões, abra, envie "teste" e
espere a resposta. Menu names may vary with the app version; say so rather than
inventing exact labels. Ask header `Celular`: `A máquina aparece e respondeu`,
`Não aparece`, `Aparece mas não abre`.

- Does not appear: the same account on phone and PC, the app updated, pull to
  refresh, the host window still open; then ask again.
- Appears but does not open: check the host window for a message and rerun the
  preflight; then ask again.

Only a detected host plus `A máquina aparece e respondeu`, given in this session,
records `phone_connected: true`. A process, a URL, a QR code or a prompt shown
on screen is never that evidence.

## 7. Record and hand back

Write `.workflows/monitoring.json` in the project as a historical record: mode
`phone`, `confirmed_by`, `observed_phone_confirmation` with its time, host name,
detected process id, measured power values, caveats and
`"valid_for_other_sessions": false`. Never write `phone_connected` there; only
the session that asks the user may set it in its own authorization. Write nothing else, and nothing outside `.workflows/`: no
scheduled task, startup shortcut, service or background logon host (hosts
started that way died about twenty seconds after the phone connected).

Close with the reminders — host window open, lid open, PC may lock — and tell
the user to answer `Concluí e o celular respondeu` back in the `/workflows`
session, which redetects the host itself; this file does not carry the
confirmation across sessions.

## After a restart or disconnection

Detect first. `claude remote-control --help` (CLI 2.1.282) documents that `-c`
reattaches to the session last recorded for this folder or one of its worktrees
and fails when nothing was recorded there within roughly the last four hours.
Offer it before a fresh host, describe the window as documented rather than
verified here, and never plan around it. Never reuse an earlier confirmation.

The survival figures above (about ninety seconds locked on battery, about twenty
seconds for hosts started from a scheduled task or background logon) and the
single-dash behaviour are observations from earlier pilots on one machine, not
guarantees. Say so when you cite them.
