# Vertical issue planning

Read the approved PRD revision and current GitHub issues/board. Reuse an existing
matching issue when its acceptance scope fits; never create a duplicate local task.
Use `templates/issue.md` and `examples/plan.json`. Before publication, temporary
integer IDs are proposal IDs only; remap every dependency to real GitHub numbers
after creation and verify links. Local status is always a timestamped snapshot.

Each issue must have outcome, boundaries/non-goals, observable acceptance,
approach and conventions to follow, seams under test, tests, dependency IDs, concrete ownership (or `*` when unknown), risks and a
session-sized end-to-end demonstration. Do not split by UI/API/database layers.
For an observation editor, prefer "save one observation and see it after reload"
with UI/API/storage/tests in one slice, then "edit with conflict feedback", then
"filter observations". If the proposal starts as database/backend/frontend
tickets, correct it yourself before presenting it; no extra user prompt needed.
A genuine prerequisite must expose a working seam tested by a named consumer.

## The slice: an issue with its sub-issues, across every layer

A slice is an issue together with its sub-issues, planned as one unit. When the
work starts from, or adopts, an existing issue, the family read in stage 2 (its
open sub-issues, down the tree) enters the plan: each sub-issue with `parent` set
to the id of its parent (a published issue keeps its GitHub number as id). A
closed sub-issue stays out of the plan; an open one that depends on it only cites
it. A family of more than 24 open issues passes the plan limit of `validate-plan`,
so ask with `AskUserQuestion` how to cut it into batches, never drop sub-issues
silently. Every batch carries the parent, and `parent` and `dependencies` must stay
inside the same plan: a child in another batch cannot cite a dependency there. Sub-issues still waiting for a decision (label `needs-decision`, or no
approach in the body) stay in the plan and go through the grilling of this same
session before their bodies are final (stage 3).

The slice as a whole, not each issue alone, must leave the requirement completely
met, so it must cover **every layer the requirement needs**. Name the candidate
layers from the code, not from a fixed list: at least screen, API, database and
migration, tests, integration and documentation, plus the project's own (for
example permissions, configuration, translation, observability, background
jobs). For each layer decide one of: handled in this issue, handled in
sub-issue #n, or not touched with the reason. Record it in the body of the parent
under `## Camadas da fatia` (`templates/issue.md`), where it covers the whole slice,
and show it in the approval table. A layer nobody analysed is a gap in the plan,
never an implicit "not touched". Each sub-issue carries the same section with only
the rows it covers.

This does not contradict the rule against splitting by layer: no issue or
sub-issue exists to deliver one layer alone. Each carries a behavior across the
layers it needs, and the layers of the whole slice add up to the full
requirement. A planned sub-issue that is only "the API part" or "the screen part"
goes back for correction before the plan is presented; one already published is
corrected by an update of stage 5, never by a silent rewrite. A finding from review
or tests (Follow-ups below) is narrow by nature and is exempt: it lists only the
layers it touches.

A parent/child link is membership, not a dependency. A child that needs its
parent's code lists the parent in `Depends on` as well; one that only belongs to
the same outcome has `Parent` alone and is free to start with the parent. A
dependency is satisfied at stage 6 either by the merge or, under the stacking
authorization, by the parent being verified on its own branch
(`references/development.md`); the plan never assumes the merge.

Seams under test name the public interfaces where each acceptance behavior is
observed (an HTTP endpoint, a CLI command, a module's exported function, a UI
action), never internals. Favor critical paths and complex logic over every edge
case. `to-development` writes tests only at these seams, so approving the issue
approves them; name them in the approval table too.

Run `frontlights.py validate-plan --plan <plan.json> --config <.frontlights/config.json>`;
this checks structure, DAG, board fields, labels, body lines and `parent` links (see Follow-ups), not semantic verticality. Review every vertical demonstration manually. Check
missing cross-layer tests, hidden sequencing, generated/shared files, migrations,
ports, shared services, dependency cycles and context size. Add dependencies or
shared ownership for resources that cannot safely run together. Split oversized
issues into independently acceptable outcomes. See `evals/vertical-slices.md`.

Before asking for approval, show the complete plan in the user's language: the
table of slices with dependencies and ownership, and the full body of every
issue, in the conversation, as a file sent with the host's file-sending tool
when one exists, and in the `preview` of the approve option (as much as fits).
Then ask approval through `AskUserQuestion`, with options, for the exact issue
creation/update scope before any write. A local project without a remote writes
the approved bodies under `.frontlights/issues/<n>/` with `source: "local"`
snapshots; the same approval rule applies. Use installed GitHub
tools or `gh issue create/edit --repo <approved-repo> --body-file <file>` with
literal UTF-8 bodies, not interpolated shell strings. Keep native permissions.
If a network response is uncertain, reread/list issues before retrying to avoid
duplicates. Record partial publication and resume remaining writes idempotently.

## Project board

When `.frontlights/config.json` has `project` (reported by `inspect` as
`sources.project`), every top-level issue this stage creates or adopts belongs on
that board; never publish one outside it. A sub-issue joins only through its parent
and takes none of the board writes below (see Follow-ups). Plan it with the issue:

- For each issue, record `issue_type` (or rely on `project.issue_type`) and
  `project_fields` for every board field whose default is `null`. Choose values
  that exist as options on the board; `validate-plan --config` refuses the plan
  while any field is still open.
- When the board configures `labels`, `issue_type_by_label` or `body_fields`, also name
  in the plan, for every top-level issue, its `labels` (at least one of each family the
  board requires, such as its kind) and its `body_fields` (one value per configured line).
  `validate-plan --config` then prints `resolved` for each top-level issue: the board
  values, the final labels (the plan's own plus the ones its field values imply), the native
  type (the plan's, else the one its labels imply, else the board default) and the body
  lines. Publish exactly that, never a value of your own: the labels and the body lines do
  not come from the board, so nothing else will fill them.
- Show the board values of every issue in the approval table (type, assignee, labels,
  body lines and each field), so approving the plan approves them. They are part of the
  named writes, not a later step.
- Create the issue with its labels and body lines in the same call: `gh issue create
  --repo <repo> --title <title> --body-file <file> --label <name>` once per resolved
  label, and one `**<name>:** <value>` line in the body per body field. Then, in this
  order: `gh project item-add <number> --owner <owner> --url <issue-url>`; `gh issue
  edit <n> --repo <repo> --add-assignee <assignee> --type <issue_type>`; one `gh project
  item-edit <number> --owner <owner> --url <issue-url> --field <name> --value <value>`
  per single-select field (`--text <value>` instead of `--value` for a text field).
  Use `assignee` exactly as configured (`@me` is whoever runs `gh`), never a guessed login.
- Verify by rereading GitHub (the issue's `projectItems`, `issueType`, `assignees`,
  `labels` and each field value) and report any value that did not land. A failed
  board write is a partial publication: record it and retry only the missing
  writes, never by creating the issue again.
- An issue that already exists (an adopted one, or one the roadmap sync completes) is edited with
  `gh issue edit <n> --repo <repo> --add-label "<name>"` once per label, `--add-assignee "<login>"`
  and `--type "<type>"`; `gh project item-add` when it is not on the board; the fields as above, with
  `--number` or `--date` for those types. Only on top of an empty value, and these writes never edit its body
  (the only body edits are a leftover criterion and the move of a legacy section, under Follow-ups).
- Every value typed into these commands goes in as one double-quoted argument, and none may hold a
  dollar sign, backtick, double quote (straight or curly: PowerShell closes a string on both),
  backslash or control character; `validate-plan` refuses a plan value that does, so reword it. A
  label must match the rule `validate-plan` applies (`LABEL_RULE` in the helper). Never invent a
  label: it must exist. The issue title is typed the same way; a title that holds those characters
  is created with `gh api` and a JSON body file instead.
- A board field that has no options on GitHub cannot hold a value: do not put it in
  `project.fields`, which would refuse every plan. If something must still be recorded for
  it, configure it as a `body_fields` line.
- If `sources.project` is `unavailable` (commonly a `gh` token without the `project`
  scope), do not publish silently outside the board. Report the exact blocked
  operation and give the user the command to fix it (`gh auth refresh -s project`).

Without `project` configured: for a repository owned by an organization, ask
through `AskUserQuestion` whether its issues live on a board (options: a board
you found with `gh project list --owner <owner>`, "no board", free text). Record
the answer in `.frontlights/config.json` as `project` (or `"project": null`) before
publishing, so later sessions do not ask again. A local project has no board.

A published sub-issue whose parent is a published issue outside the plan (an adopted
child) carries `parent_external: <parent number>` in `plan.json` instead of `parent`:
it takes no board field and joins the board only through its parent, and the limits
of 100 children and 8 levels are read from GitHub before publishing, since the plan
does not hold its ancestors. The two keys are exclusive.

Put `Depends on: #N, #M` and `Parent: #P` in each canonical issue body (or `none`), and
the `## Camadas da fatia` table of the slice;
verify dependency IDs, parent and content after publication. Link local snapshots to returned issue URLs.
An issue update preserves user text outside the approved plan. Surface divergence
between approved draft and GitHub rather than overwriting it silently. Return
verified issue links/graph to the coordinator for batch authorization.

## Follow-ups

Findings from an independent review, a test run, a live check or another verification
pass that belong to an issue never become one new issue each. Classify every finding
by the first destination that fits:

1. Fix it in the same PR, when it is inside the issue's approved scope and ownership.
2. A new acceptance criterion in the source issue, written as a checklist item
   (`- [ ] ...`) inside its acceptance-criteria section, for a small leftover that
   does not need its own branch or review (recipe: "A leftover as an acceptance
   criterion", below). The issue is done only when the leftover is treated, completed
   and ticked with evidence, like any other criterion.
3. A sub-issue of the source issue, for work of its own that still belongs to that
   outcome.
4. A top-level issue only for new scope or for a problem that crosses several
   issues; then make it a sub-issue of the epic that gathers them, when one exists.

Every finding that is not fixed in the PR leaves with a destination GitHub tracks
(destination 2, 3 or 4); text in the PR body is never a destination (the gate, below).

No finding becomes a top-level issue by default. Show the whole batch (each finding,
its proposed destination with the reason, and the full text of every new criterion
and sub-issue body) under the show-before-approval rule, then decide it in a
single `AskUserQuestion`: one option approves the proposed destinations and their named
writes, others adjust them. Approving the batch approves exactly those writes, with the
criterion text exactly as shown; it is not an implementation authorization for the new
work. The new sub-issues join the
slice of their parent (with the `## Camadas da fatia` rows they cover); to implement
them in the same execution, ask the extended authorization in a new `AskUserQuestion`,
stacked on the parent's branch when they depend on it.

Record each sub-issue in `plan.json` with `parent` set to the id of the source issue,
which must be in the same plan (a published issue keeps its GitHub number as id), so
`validate-plan` checks the link without network. A sub-issue takes no
`project_fields`. The check counts only the plan's children (GitHub allows 100 per
parent), so before publishing read the parent's `subIssuesSummary.total` with `gh issue
view <parent> --json subIssuesSummary` and keep that total plus the new children at
100 or fewer. When the parent is itself a sub-issue, include its ancestors too, so
the depth check (8 levels below a top-level issue) sees the whole chain.

Publish a sub-issue in this order, pausing a few seconds between creations to stay
under the secondary rate limit:

- Read what the child inherits: `gh issue view <parent> --repo <repo> --json
  assignees,labels,issueType,state`. Those names come from GitHub, where anyone with triage access
  can create a label: type each one as one double-quoted argument under the rule of the Project
  board section above (no dollar sign, backtick, double quote, backslash or control character; a
  label must match `LABEL_RULE`), and skip, then report, any value that breaks it.
- Create it already linked: `gh issue create --repo <repo> --title <title> --body-file <file> --parent <parent>`
  plus one `--assignee <login>` per parent assignee, one `--label <name>` per parent
  label and `--type <issueType.name>` when the parent has a type. Put `Parent: #<parent>`
  in the body. For an issue that already exists, link it with `gh issue edit <child>
  --repo <repo> --parent <parent>` (or `gh issue edit <parent> --repo <repo>
  --add-sub-issue <child>`).
- A `gh` without these flags falls back to the REST route: `gh api
  repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<parent>/sub_issues --method POST -F sub_issue_id=<id>`,
  where `<id>` is the child's numeric `id` from `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<child>`
  (not its number).
- Run no board command for the child: the parent's card shows the children's
  progress (x/y).

Verify by rereading GitHub: `gh issue view <child> --repo <repo> --json
parent,projectItems,assignees,labels,issueType` must show `parent.number` equal to the
parent, an empty `projectItems` and the inherited values; `gh issue view <parent>
--repo <repo> --json subIssuesSummary` must show the total grown by the new children
(the REST listing `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<parent>/sub_issues` is the
fallback). A child that landed on a board anyway (a project auto-add rule, say) is a
divergence to report, not to undo. A failed link is a partial publication: retry only
the link, never by creating the issue again.

A parent is reported complete only when every child is closed
(`subIssuesSummary.completed` equal to `total`); otherwise list the open children.
A late finding, after the parent was closed, still becomes a sub-issue of
it: say that the parent must be reopened for its progress to count, and leave that
decision to the user; never reopen, delete or archive an issue yourself, and close or move one
only through the closeout approval of `references/closeout.md`. A parent that was only
merged and is still open follows the ladder above like any other.

### A leftover as an acceptance criterion

A leftover is not an appendix of the issue: it is one more acceptance criterion. It goes
into the acceptance-criteria section (`Acceptance criteria`, `Critérios de aceitação` or
`Critérios de aceite`), never into a section of its own, because that section is the
only one `scripts/closeout.py` counts: a leftover kept anywhere else would let the issue
be proposed for closing with it still open. A source issue that has no such section, or is
closed, cannot take destination 2 (a section holding only the leftover would make the
closeout read the issue as finished once it is ticked, and an unticked criterion
contradicts a closed issue): use a sub-issue and say why.

- **Text.** One objective, observable item that names the evidence that will close it
  (a test at a seam, a measured result, a reviewed diff), in the user's language and
  prefixed with where it came from: `- [ ] Pendência (achado da revisão): <what must be
  true>. Evidência que fecha: <evidence>` (`do teste ao vivo`, `dos testes` or `da
  conferência` for the other origins). Several leftovers are several items.
- **Approval.** It changes the issue's scope, so, like any update of a published issue, it
  keeps what is there and is shown before it is written (the update rule at the end of
  the Project board section): the exact text, the issue and its place in the section go
  in the batch above and are approved in that single question. Nothing is written before
  the answer.
- **Capture.** Save the body exactly as GitHub holds it, with this command and never with
  a shell redirect (Windows PowerShell re-encodes redirected output, and `--jq .body`
  adds a newline): `python -c "import json,subprocess,pathlib; b=json.loads(subprocess.run(['gh','issue','view','<n>','--repo','<repo>','--json','body'],capture_output=True,check=True).stdout)['body']; pathlib.Path(r'<file>').write_bytes(b.encode('utf-8'))"`.
  The first copy is `.frontlights/issues/<n>/body-before-<YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ>.md` (UTC, no
  colon: a colon is not valid in a Windows file name; create the folder first when it
  does not exist) and each later one, with its own stamp, `body-now-<stamp>.md`. Run
  `python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/closeout.py" candidates --config <config> --root
  <project> --issues <n>` (read only) once now: its `criteria.total`, under `candidates`
  or `excluded`, is the baseline.
- **Write.** Build the new body as a copy of the saved one with only the new items
  inserted right after the last item of the section, by an exact-replace edit of the
  copy and never by retyping the whole body; the file tool writes UTF-8 without a
  byte-order mark, and mixed line endings are harmless to GitHub and to the closeout.
  Check the new file against the saved copy before writing: `git diff --no-index
  --ignore-cr-at-eol --numstat <before> <new>` must show no deleted line. Capture the
  body once more right before writing and compare it with the saved copy (`git diff
  --no-index --ignore-cr-at-eol --exit-code <before> <now>`): any difference means
  someone edited the issue meanwhile, so stop and show it instead of overwriting. Then
  write it with `gh issue edit <n> --repo <repo> --body-file <file>`, a literal UTF-8
  file, never an interpolated string. GitHub offers no compare-and-swap, so an edit
  landing between that last comparison and the write is a known limit.
- **Verify.** Run the same closeout command again: `criteria.total` must have grown by
  the number of items added, and the issue stays out of the list as `unchecked_criteria`
  (or `open_children` while a child is open) until they are ticked. Capture the body
  again and compare it with the saved copy with the same flag (`--ignore-cr-at-eol`): the
  only differences are the added lines, inside the section (in a legacy migration, also
  the removed legacy lines). Anything else is a divergence to show and ask about;
  restoring the saved body is a write of its own and needs its own approval.
- **Record.** Put the approved text, the user's literal answer with a reference, the
  saved copies and the verified difference in the handoff, and note the write in the
  authorization's record of GitHub writes when the session has one.
- **Treat it.** The leftover is worked like any other criterion of the family. Tick it
  only with evidence, under the authorization for routine issue updates
  (`references/development.md`), and never to get the issue closed. While one is open,
  the PR cites the issue without a closing keyword (`Closes`, `Fixes`, `Resolves`), in
  its body and in the commit messages, because the merge would close the issue with the
  criterion unticked.

A leftover already kept in a section of its own (a body written before this rule) is
moved into the criteria only when the user asks for it, as a write of this recipe with
its own approval: the open items are added to the criteria (text shown first) and the
same items are removed from the old section, so the only differences are those added
lines and those removed ones. Until then the closeout only warns about it
(`pending_outside_criteria`).

### The gate: no open finding without a destination

Before an issue is reported as reviewed or complete, and before a PR is opened or
updated, list every open finding of the review, the tests, the live check and any other
verification pass, the ones of earlier rounds included, each with its destination: fixed
(the commit), new criterion (the issue and the exact text), sub-issue or top-level issue
(its number), not a defect, or dropped by the user. The report shows that list.

- A finding with none of these stops the report and the PR: say how many are open and
  run the ladder above for them, as one batch.
- A mention in the PR body, in a comment, in the chat or in the handoff is never a
  destination: none of them is tracked, and the PR text is out of sight after the merge. The
  PR body may repeat an item as context, but only when it also has its destination, which
  the body then cites.
- Only noise that is not a defect may stay as text: a 404 for a file that is only missing
  from the local disk, test data left behind, an error line of the tool itself. Say "não
  é defeito" and give the evidence that shows it (the command and what it returned). When
  in doubt it is a finding.
- Only the user can drop a finding that has no destination, by an explicit answer to the
  batch question (its adjust option): record the answer verbatim in the handoff and
  report the finding as "descartado pelo usuário". Never offer it as the default and
  never infer it from silence.
- The handoff keeps the list: "Achados sem correção e destino de cada um"
  (`templates/handoff.md`).
