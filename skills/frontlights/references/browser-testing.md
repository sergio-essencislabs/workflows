# Browser, checks and cross-account testing

Read this in stage 6 whenever anything the session delivers changes what the user
sees: the plan has the section `## Navegador e testes ligados` (`templates/issue.md`)
with `Toca o frontend: sim`, or `browser-gate` (below) finds a visible change in the
diff. It decides what runs, with which helper, what to ask and what to record. Everything the user reads stays in
Portuguese. `checks integration` and `checks smoke` refuse a non-local host
before any request; `serve start` does not check the `health` host, so keep
`health` and `baseUrl` on `127.0.0.1`, `localhost` or `::1`, on the branch under test
(a watched run also serves the base, see below); never point a test at a real, staging or production environment. Installing Playwright or a browser in the target project is out of
scope: use what the session and the project already have. A run never stops or skips a case
for lack of test data: it creates what the `Fluxo:` needs and removes it afterwards (section "Test data the
run creates").

## What the plan turns on

Read the four fields of that section and restate them in the handoff before
running anything:

- `Toca o frontend:` `sim` turns the browser test on; `não` skips it.
- `Conta:` `conta 1` (the default) or `contas 1 e 2`.
- `Fluxo:` the screens and actions to exercise, with the expected result, and the
  effect in the back and the database after saving (what changes in the row or in the
  behavior), checked through the product's own read path or a read-only query the
  project already permits, never only what the screen shows.
- `Testes ligados:` any of `navegador`, `integração`, `regressão`,
  `permissões entre contas`, `smoke`, plus extra cases.

A missing section on an issue that changes screens, or a field that contradicts the
diff, parks the issue and goes to `AskUserQuestion` (`browser-gate` finds that
contradiction from the diff); never turn tests on or off alone. Run only what is on, in this order: `checks regression`, `serve start`,
`checks integration`, browser and cross-account steps (the browser step opens with
the watched-run question below and, when the user watched, ends with the question of
what to do next), `checks smoke` (it reuses the running serve),
`serve stop`. The commands below read `browserTest` and `checks` from the project's
`.frontlights/config.json` (main worktree included, as stage 2 says).

## One watched run per batch

There is one watched run per batch of work, never one per branch or worktree. The batch is
every slice the session delivers together: the issue and its sub-issues, and any other issue
authorized in the same run. A slice that only changes tests or only the API does not hold the
question back.

**When the question comes out.** Only at these points, each one after `browser-gate`: (a) when the
last slice that changes the screen has closed its TDD loop, the normal moment, which comes before
the independent review of any of them (a review of work the user then asks to change is wasted);
(b) before an independent review of a slice that changes the screen is dispatched, once no other
slice that changes the screen is still in its loop (otherwise that review waits for (a)); (c) before an
issue that changes the screen (a visible file in its `by_root`, or a plan that says `sim`) is
reported as reviewed or complete; (d) before a PR of such an issue is opened or updated; (e) when a session
resumes with `teste_assistido` pending (it exists only once the question is due). At any other moment a `pending` is expected and asks nothing:
a commit in a slice, or a screen slice still in its loop, is no reason to ask. A screen slice
that is parked or dropped leaves the batch, and the question names the slices it covers; one that
comes back later is a new decision (`stale`). The session does not
wait for the sibling slices, their reviews or the family integration.

**What runs.** One ANTES on the approved base of the batch and one DEPOIS on the delivered state of
the slices that have closed their loop at that moment: the branch itself when the batch has one
branch, otherwise a local integration worktree (never pushed) that merges them, the one the family
integration of `development.md` reuses and redoes after a fix. Every `Fluxo:` of the batch runs in
those same two passes. A slice that closes its loop after the run and changes what a `Fluxo:`
exercises (the same screen or route) makes the session ask again by hand, with the options of `stale`, because the gate cannot see
that; until it is answered the report says "implementada, aguardando teste assistido", never "completa".

**The gate.** `python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/frontlights.py" browser-gate --config <config>
--base <base> --root <worktree> [--root <worktree> ...] [--stacked <branch>=<target> ...] --toca
<sim|nao|ausente> --record <result.json>`. `--base` is the approved base of the batch, the same for
every `--root`; each `--root` is a slice's worktree; each slice stacked on another branch (the base
the stacking authorization records for it) is named with `--stacked <its branch>=<the branch its PR
targets>`, so only its own changes count (an API-only child stacked on a parent that changes the
screen is then no visible root); without `--stacked` every root is measured from `--base`; `--toca` is `sim` when any slice's plan says `Toca o frontend: sim`, else what the plans
say (`by_root` lists the visible files of each root, so compare each slice with its own plan);
`--record` is the batch record below and may not exist yet. It reads the Git diff, not the plan's
text, and prints `status`, `reason` and `action`. Exit code 0 means `not_needed` or `answered`, 2
anything else, 1 an error such as an unreadable file or a base that does not exist (a `--config`
path that does not exist is an error: leave `--config` out only when the project has none). On exit
code 1 say the error in one line and fix the call; it is never `answered`.

- `pending` (action `ask`): nobody has decided (`sem-registro`, `pendente`, `ainda-nao` or
  `alteracao`). For `alteracao` the change comes first and the run then repeats with no new
  "pronto para assistir?"; for the others ask the question of the next section, at the points above.
- `contradiction` (`ask-plan`): the diff changes what the user sees and the plan says `não` or says
  nothing. Tell them and ask with `AskUserQuestion`; options: "Rodar o teste assistido" (and fix
  `Toca o frontend:` in the local plan with their answer; the issue body is an external write that
  needs its own approval), "Dispensar o teste" (record `dispensado`: the
  right answer when the change is not really visible) and "Ainda não".
- `stale` (`ask-again`): the user decided, then code that is not a test or a document changed in a
  slice that changes the screen (`changed_roots` names it), or the record has no `lote.roots`
  (`sem-vinculo`). Ask with options "Assistir de novo" (a new run), "Manter a decisão anterior" (copy
  the new `roots` into the record and write the answer verbatim in `pergunta.resposta`) and
  "Ainda não"; in a project with no `browserTest` only the last two make sense.
- `unconfigured` (`ask-how`): something visible changed and the project has no `browserTest`, so the
  run cannot happen. Ask with options "Verificar à mão e dispensar" (record `dispensado` and the risk
  in the report), "Configurar o `browserTest` agora" and "Ainda não". Never call the change checked.

The visible paths are `browserTest.frontPaths` of the project's config (globs from the repository
root: `*` stays inside one folder, so say `**/*.html` for every page; tests and documents never count
and a screen file never counts as a test); without it the gate guesses from file names, and `inspect`
warns about that. Limits: a script or an image inside a test or documentation folder stays out even
when `frontPaths` names it, markdown pages never count, and an HTML fixture inside a test folder is
asked about (answer `dispensado`).

**The record.** The batch has one `result.json`, in the folder of its lead issue (the parent of a
family, or the lowest-numbered issue of the batch): `.frontlights/issues/<lead>/browser/result.json`.
Besides the fields of the Evidence section it carries `situacao` (`pendente`, `ainda-nao`,
`aprovado`, `prosseguir`, `sem-assistir`, `dispensado` or `alteracao`), `lote` with `issues` (the
numbers) and `roots` (copied from the `browser-gate` output taken when the answer was recorded,
which is what `stale` compares with) and `pergunta.resposta`, the user's answer verbatim. "Ainda não"
is `ainda-nao`: the run stays owed, as the `teste_assistido` pending of `checkpoint --pending` and
`context --pending` (so `resume` reports it and a window near its limit asks before spending more),
and the question comes back at the points above, not at every commit. It is carried that way only
once the question is due: the last slice that changes the screen has closed its loop and the user has
not answered, or said "Ainda não" (a slice that reopens its loop after that does not undo it: the handoff
carries both, and the question comes out again when that slice closes). A slice of the batch that has not
started yet counts as open. While a screen slice is still in its loop the handoff lists the open screen
slices instead, a window near its limit just renews, and the next window continues that
slice. "Rodar sem assistir" is
`sem-assistir` once it ran; the user's explicit decision not to run it is `dispensado`; the closing
question gives `aprovado`, `prosseguir` and `alteracao`. `answered` (any of `aprovado`, `prosseguir`,
`sem-assistir` or `dispensado`) is what an independent review of a slice that changes the screen,
"reviewed", "complete" and a PR require; there is no other way around it.

A Direct change with no issue has no plan and no lead issue. Ask with `AskUserQuestion`, options "Informar a
issue" (the issue the work belongs to, which the user names: its number serves the record, `serve` and
`checks`), "Dispensar o teste" (record `dispensado`) and "Ainda não". Never run `serve` or `checks` with an
invented number, and open no issue for it. `--toca` is `ausente`, so a visible diff is a `contradiction`
(in a project with no `browserTest` it is `unconfigured`), which this same question answers. A dispensed
Direct change keeps its record in `.frontlights/direct/<branch, slashes as dashes>/browser/result.json`
(`--record` points there; the answer verbatim and the risk go in the handoff and the report too).

## Environment: `serve`

```powershell
python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/serve.py" start --config <config> --root <worktree> --issue <n>
python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/serve.py" status --config <config> --root <worktree> --issue <n>
python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/serve.py" stop --config <config> --root <worktree> --issue <n>
```

`serve start` brings up every process of `browserTest.processes` in the issue's
worktree, waits for each health URL and records pids in
`.frontlights/serve/<n>.json`; `serve stop` kills the process trees and releases
the ports. Exit `0` done, `1` refused or failed; the JSON `category` says:

- `uso`: invalid config or a busy lock;
- `infraestrutura`: everything else, an unreadable or missing config included.

Either way, ask (see below).

A project whose `browserTest` declares only the accounts (`inspect` warns about it) starts its own
environment: skip `serve start` and `serve stop`, confirm with the user that the environment is up and on the branch under test, and never start or stop a process this session did not start.

Ports. A process with `"port": "auto"` gets a free port reserved per process in the
repository's Git common directory, shared by every worktree, and receives it in
`PORT`, `FRONTLIGHTS_PORT_<NAME>` and `{port}` in its argv. Its health must carry
`{port}` in place of the host's port (`http://127.0.0.1:{port}/health`); `{port}`
only in the path is refused as `uso`. The output reports
`reservas_compartilhadas`. Use `auto` only when the process really accepts the
port by variable or argument. A dev server that pins its own ports keeps a fixed
`port`, and then only one issue at a time can run it: say so when recommending
parallelism. A process that ignores the reserved port fails the start as
infrastructure, naming the process.

Stop what this session started before reporting the issue, and say in one line
which processes are still up when the user chose to keep them.

## Checks: `checks`

```powershell
python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/checks.py" regression --config <config> --root <worktree> `
  --base <base-checkout> --issue <n>
python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/checks.py" integration --config <config> --root <worktree> `
  --issue <n> --base <base-checkout>
python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/checks.py" smoke --config <config> --root <worktree> `
  --issue <n> --base <base-checkout>
```

- `checks regression` runs the suite on the base and then on the branch; only a
  new failure blocks, a failure already on the base is reported apart.
- `checks integration` runs `checks.integration.argv` against the backend that
  `serve start` brought up; it never starts anything itself.
- `checks smoke` starts the serve when none is up, requests the declared paths and
  stops only what it started; a warning "Rode `serve stop`" means an orphan was
  left: tell the user and offer to run `serve stop`.

Exit codes: `0` passed, `1` product failure, `2` config or usage refused (nothing
ran), `3` infrastructure. Records go to `.frontlights/issues/<n>/checks/`; those
of `integration` and `smoke` carry `simulacao: false`. A login or password of `browserTest.users` shorter than four
characters makes `integration` and `smoke` refuse; both values are masked in every
output and record.

## Browser

Explore with the browser available in the session (Chrome or Claude's browser);
run the project's own Playwright specs when it already has them. Open the
`browserTest.baseUrl` of the branch, log in with account 1 and walk the `Fluxo:`
step by step, comparing each screen with the expected result. Collect console
errors, failed network requests and a screenshot per step. Type credentials only
into the login form; never repeat them in the conversation, a record or a
screenshot caption.

Without a browser or network the test did not run: report the reason, record it,
and the issue never counts as passed on that test.

## Watched run: before and after, with the user watching

Whenever the plan turns the browser test on (`Toca o frontend: sim`) or `browser-gate`
finds a visible change, ask once per batch (the section above), before the browser opens its
first window (the servers may already be up), with `AskUserQuestion`: "Pronto para
assistir ao teste de navegador da issue #<n>?" (for a batch, "das issues #<n>, #<m> e #<k>",
each one named in the text). The text says what comes: first the
base (ANTES), then the delivered state (DEPOIS), each case twice, and the window stays open
for about 5 minutes at the end; that the run creates the test data the `Fluxo:` needs (users, accounts and
the like) and removes it afterwards; and, when the `Fluxo:` moves a test user to a restricted
profile, that this changes data of the test database through the product's endpoint
and that it will be undone. Options: "Sim, pode rodar" first and recommended;
"Ainda não" (park the browser test and go on with other work, run nothing; the user
says when ready); "Rodar sem assistir" (a hidden window is acceptable; record
`assistido: false`). When the `Fluxo:` moves a profile, a fourth option, "Sem mudar
perfil", runs both passes without the move and declares in the report that the
permission behavior was not checked against the real back. Never open the browser
before the answer. Passes never overlap: one issue at a time (a batch counts as one),
never several windows at once on the same account and database.

When the user will watch:

- **Visible window.** Chrome with a visible window, never headless (`headless:
  false` in Playwright, or the session's browser on screen), in a disposable browser
  context or profile, never the user's personal one. If the session cannot open
  one, the watched run did not happen: report the reason and ask; never fall back to
  a hidden window silently.
- **The whole screen, always.** The user must see the whole page and the strip without
  scrolling or resizing anything. Size the window to the screen's available area (start
  maximized, or read the screen size and open the window at it) and let the page
  viewport follow the window (`viewport: null` in Playwright), never a fixed viewport
  larger than the screen: a page that overflows the window hides its edges and the
  strip. Before the first case of each pass, take a screenshot and check that the strip and
  every edge of the page are inside it; when something is cut off, resize and check
  again, and never go on with a cut-off window.
- **Two passes, same scenario and same account.** ANTES runs the `Fluxo:` on the
  approved base of the batch (`main`, or the default branch); a slice stacked on a
  parent that is not part of the batch uses that parent's branch, the base of its PR.
  Serve it from a checkout of that
  base, a detached-HEAD worktree made with `git worktree add` because the base
  branch is already checked out elsewhere; for that stacked slice the
  parent's own worktree can serve as ANTES. It gets its own record (`serve start --root <base-checkout>
  --issue <n>`). DEPOIS runs the same `Fluxo:`, same account, same data, on the
  delivered state (the batch's single branch, or the local integration of the slices that
  closed their loop), served from its worktree. Give both servers an `auto` port of their
  own. A process with a fixed port runs one pass at a time, in this order: stop the
  issue's own server (the standard order started it earlier), start ANTES, run it,
  `serve stop --root <base-checkout> --issue <n>` ends ANTES before DEPOIS starts, then
  start the issue's server again (`checks smoke` needs it up). After each `serve start`
  confirm that the process answering on the port is the recorded one or a descendant
  of it (`serve status` and the owning pid of `Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort
  <port>`), or DEPOIS could be answered by the base. Stop the ANTES record in every
  case before reporting.
- **A strip on every page.** The test injects a fixed strip into the page, pinned to the
  top edge across the full width, thin, above every other element and never
  covered by a popup, toast or dialog (an init script or a DOM node, visible in the screenshots): "ANTES: <base>" ("ANTES: main"
  on the main, the base's own name otherwise) in the first pass and
  "DEPOIS: branch <name>" in the second, with the branch name as Git has it. No
  login, password or local path ever goes into the strip.
- **Pace.** Each case runs twice in each pass. Hold every popup, toast and dialog
  on screen long enough to be read (a few seconds), not the instant the assertion
  passes. After the last step of each pass (ANTES and DEPOIS) leave the window open for
  about 5 minutes, held by a background process so that the wait never blocks the agent.
  The holder is started with `run_in_background` by whoever drives the pass, and it
  exits when the user closes the window (the browser's `disconnected` event) or when the 5
  minutes end, whichever comes first; at the 5 minutes it closes the window itself before
  exiting, and it prints which of the two ended it. Its exit is the
  notice: the harness wakes the one who started it, so nobody polls and nobody waits for
  a report that never comes. A bare timer or `sleep` is not a holder, because nothing
  wakes the driver when the user closes the window early.
- **Window closed, next step.** The notice is the same whether the user closed the window
  or the 5 minutes ended it: the session goes on without waiting for anyone. When the ANTES holder exits, stop the ANTES server and
  only then start DEPOIS; never start DEPOIS before that notice. When the DEPOIS holder
  exits, the pass is over and the driver reports at once. When a subagent drives the
  passes, it does not return its report before the DEPOIS holder exits, so that the
  session waiting for the report is woken by the window closing. The closing question
  below is asked while the DEPOIS window is still open, as soon as the results are in the
  text and any restricted profile is already restored, when the session itself drives the
  passes; with a subagent it is asked once the report arrives, with the window already
  closed. Closing the window or the 5 minutes ending is never an answer to that question.
- **Faithful ANTES.** The base must run against the data it expects. When the issue
  has a migration, run ANTES before applying it, or against an isolated database;
  otherwise say in the report that ANTES is not a faithful baseline.

Compare the two passes case by case in the report. ANTES failing where the issue
fixes something is expected; DEPOIS differing from the `Fluxo:` is a product
failure.

**After the watched run: ask what comes next.** Asked only when the user watched
(`assistido: true`); a run with "Rodar sem assistir" has no one to answer it. Once the
last step of DEPOIS has run and the result of each case is in the text (ANTES and DEPOIS side
by side, with the evidence folder), with the window still open for its 5 minutes (or already closed,
when a subagent drove the passes) and the
original profile already restored and read back, ask with `AskUserQuestion`: "O que fazer depois do
teste assistido da issue #<n>?" (for a batch, "das issues #<n>, #<m> e #<k>", as in the first question)
Options, in this order: "Assistir de novo", "Aprovado",
"Precisa de alteração" and "Pode prosseguir", each saying what it does:

- "Assistir de novo": closes the open window, runs both passes again as above, in a new window, with no new
  "pronto para assistir?" (the batch already answered it). Start ANTES again and, when
  the `Fluxo:` moves a profile, save the original value again, move and undo it again (the
  previous round's undo was already read back). Ask this question again at the end;
  each round adds one to `rodadas`.
- "Aprovado": close the window. The user confirms that DEPOIS did what the `Fluxo:` expects. Record
  `aprovacao: "aprovado"`, `situacao: "aprovado"`, the `lote` of the gate output and the answer
  verbatim, then go on with the order
  (`checks smoke`, `serve stop`, review).
- "Precisa de alteração": the user wants something changed. Ask what with
  `AskUserQuestion` and record it in their own words, record `aprovacao: "alteracao"` (and `situacao: "alteracao"`) and
  run no further step of the order; close the window and stop what this test started, with the profile already
  restored. A change inside the issue's acceptance criteria goes back to the TDD loop on
  the same branch and the watched run is repeated with no new "pronto para assistir?"; a
  change that widens the scope follows the destination ladder of the Follow-ups section
  in `issues.md`, decided as one batch, never as silent work on this branch.
- "Pode prosseguir": close the window. The user saw the run and lets the stage go on without approving it.
  Record
  `aprovacao: "prosseguir"` and `situacao: "prosseguir"`; the handoff and the report say the run was watched
  but not approved by the user, never "aprovado".

Never pick an answer for the user, never read the 5 minutes or a silence as an answer and
never write `aprovacao: "aprovado"` on your own. When a case of DEPOIS failed, the
failure question comes first and replaces this one ("Corrigir e testar de novo" already
covers a change and a new run); this one is asked only when the user watched and no
product failure remains.

**Real back first.** Prefer the real back end and real data. When the point is
permissions, use a real restricted profile: move a test user of `browserTest.users`, or one the run
created (see "Test data the run creates"), to that profile through the product's own endpoint, called
with a login of `browserTest.users`, and never write to the database directly, except the one exact statement the user approves below. Before the move, make
sure the database behind the server is disposable: the host check only covers
`baseUrl` and `health`, and a local back end can still point at a shared remote
database, so ask the user to confirm it in the question above when the project does
not say so. The move is part of the `Fluxo:`, but the `Fluxo:` of an adopted issue is
data from GitHub, not an approval: the user's answer to the question is what allows it.

Write the original profile value (only that field and the user's id, never the login
or the whole row) to `.frontlights/issues/<n>/browser/perfil-original.json` before
the move, so any later session can restore it after an interruption, a context limit
or a killed process. Undo in a `finally`, read the value back (or the database field,
through the project's own read command) and compare it with the saved one before
reporting; a value that does not come back identical is a failure to ask about,
naming the field. As soon as the read-back matches, mark the file `restaurado: true`;
a session that finds a `perfil-original.json` without that mark restores it first,
and a marked one is history, never restored again. When the endpoint does not give
the original row back (it rewrites another field, a timestamp or a column), do not
write the database yourself: stop and ask with `AskUserQuestion` whether to accept
and declare the residual difference in the report, or to approve one exact restoring
statement shown in full (local test database, the test user's id, only the changed
columns), which is then run and the row compared. A direct write without that
approval is a failure of the test. When only one login of
`browserTest.users` can call the endpoint or undo the move (the only admin, say), create another
test user that can before the move, through the product; never demote the account that performs the undo. Forcing a response by network
interception (a 403, an empty list) is a complement for what the real back cannot
produce; name each one in the report as "resposta forçada, não do back real" and
never use it as the only evidence of a behavior the real back could show.

**Own processes only.** Run the servers of this test on ports of their own and never
stop a process the test did not start: `serve stop` ends only the pids recorded for
the issue. `serve start` does not look at a fixed port before spawning, so check it
first (`Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort <port>`). When it already answers and no
record of this issue explains it, it belongs to another session: leave it alone, do
not start on top of it, and ask (switch to `auto`, wait, or another port).

## Test data the run creates

The user's standing decision, for every project and every run (watched or not): a browser or cross-account
test creates the test data the `Fluxo:` needs to run completely and removes it afterwards. Missing data is
never a reason to skip a case, shorten a pass, park the run or ask the user to supply a login.

- **What.** Users (the owner and a non-owner of the same account, a user with a restricted profile), a
  second account or tenant for the cross-account case, companies, profiles, grants and any record the
  `Fluxo:` touches, as far as the product lets a test create them.
- **How.** Through the product's own endpoints and screens, called with a login of `browserTest.users`.
  The only exception to "never write the database directly" is the one exact statement the user approves
  (see "Real back first" and "Cleanup" below).
- **Where.** Only on the disposable local database that "Real back first" already requires. Never
  production, staging or a shared remote database. Never read, change or reuse a real person's or customer's
  user, profile or data: the run touches only what it created or the logins of `browserTest.users`.
- **Record.** Before the first creation write `.frontlights/issues/<n>/browser/dados-de-teste.json` (the
  lead issue's folder) and add each item as it is created: its kind and id, `removido: false`. Never the
  login, the password or a whole row. The password of a created login goes only into a git-ignored local
  file of the project and reaches the browser through an environment variable of the process; never into
  a record, a caption, the strip, a screenshot, the conversation or a brief.
- **Cleanup.** At the end of the run: after the closing answer of a watched one (not after "Assistir de
  novo", where the data stays for the next round, and after "Precisa de alteração" only once the changed
  flow has run again and been answered), and right after the last case of a run with no watcher. Remove the items in reverse order of creation through the same endpoints, in a `finally`,
  read each one back and set `removido: true`. A session that finds a `dados-de-teste.json` with an entry
  not marked `removido: true` removes it first, as it does for `perfil-original.json`. What the product
  cannot remove (deleting a user only anonymizes it, say) is never left unreported: list it in the report
  with the exact `DELETE` statement of each id this run created (local test database, only those ids),
  and run them only after the user approves the statements shown in full with `AskUserQuestion`.
- **Briefs.** Every brief handed to a subagent or another session that runs the test carries this
  section's rule. A brief never says "não crie usuário", "pare se faltar login" or "espere a decisão";
  a brief that runs the test says to create what is missing and to remove it afterwards.
- **Not a question.** This is not asked per run; the watched-run question only says that it happens.
  Ask only about what this section does not settle: a statement outside the product's endpoints, and the
  residue statements above.

## Cross-account permissions

Account 1 is the first entry of `browserTest.users`, account 2 the second.
Account 1 runs every browser test. Account 2 enters only when `Conta:` names it or
`Testes ligados:` includes `permissões entre contas`. Then:

1. With account 1, create or open the data the issue touches and note its
   identifiers and URLs.
2. Log out, log in with account 2 and try to reach that data: lists, search,
   direct URL, edit and delete actions, and the API calls the screens make.
3. Repeat the other way when the plan says the data is private to both.

Any data of one account visible to, or changeable by, the other is a
product failure. A missing account 2, or an account 2 that is the same account or tenant as account 1 when the
case is cross-tenant, is test data the run creates (previous section): create it, never reuse account 1 as both.

## Every failure is a question

Classify each failure before asking:

- **infrastructure failure**: `serve` category `infraestrutura`, `checks` code
  `3`, no browser or network, login page unreachable.
- **product failure**: `checks` code `1`, a new regression failure, a wrong
  screen, console or network error caused by the issue, failed login with valid
  test accounts, data crossing accounts.
- **config refusal**: `serve` category `uso` or `checks` code `2`.

Report the three kinds separately, then ask with `AskUserQuestion`, one question
per failure (batched when several), with the evidence path in the text and options
such as "Bloquear a issue", "Corrigir e testar de novo", "Seguir e registrar o
risco". Never decide alone to retry, ignore or continue; an issue with a failure
is reported as passed only when every test passed or the user chose to go on, and
the answer is recorded verbatim.

## Evidence

Before each browser run, take `python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/frontlights.py" evidence --root <worktree>`.
Write `.frontlights/issues/<n>/browser/result.json` (for a batch, `<n>` is its lead issue and
the file is the batch's) with timestamp, branch,
`head`, `diff_sha256`, the account used (`conta 1` or `conta 2`, never the login),
each step and its result, console and network errors, screenshot file names, the
failure kind and the user's answer. A watched run adds `assistido` (true or
false), `rodadas` (how many times the user watched both passes), `aprovacao` (`aprovado`,
`prosseguir` or `alteracao`) with the answer to the closing question verbatim, one entry
per pass (`ANTES`/`DEPOIS`, with the branch and `head` served and `repeticoes: 2`), the
source of each response (`back real` or `interceptada`) and,
when a profile was moved, only the profile field before and after the undo (never
the whole row, which can hold a login or a password hash); its screenshots are
named `antes-<caso>-<n>` and `depois-<caso>-<n>`. Screenshots stay in the same folder, and so do `perfil-original.json` and `dados-de-teste.json`. The
records of `.frontlights/issues/<n>/checks/` sit beside it. The records are
tied to the `head` they ran on: for the watched run `browser-gate` says whether the record still covers the
code (`stale` asks again), and the `checks` records are stale after any later commit, so rerun them before
reporting. Link both folders in the
handoff.

A summary comment on the GitHub issue is text only (no screenshots, no login,
no password, no local path) and is posted only when the recorded authorization
allows routine issue updates; otherwise keep it in the handoff as pending.

## Prints kept for the progress summary

The DEPOIS pass of a watched run is also the cheapest moment to take the prints the "Resumo para a
diretoria" will need (`progress-report.md` step 6 offers them). Taking them costs one extra capture per
visible case and nothing leaves the project.

- **Which.** In DEPOIS only, never ANTES, one print per case of the `Fluxo:` that shows something a
  person would recognise (a screen, a message, a list), taken right after the case passes.
- **Clean.** Without the ANTES/DEPOIS strip, without the browser chrome, with no login, no person's name or
  data and no local path: crop, or choose another view of the same result, or take no print for that case. Test
  data only. JPEG or PNG, at most 1 MB and about 1920 px wide. Look at every image yourself and retake the
  blurry, empty or error ones.
- **Where.** `.frontlights/issues/<n>/browser/resumo/` (the lead issue's folder) of the project's **main
  worktree** (the first one `git worktree list` shows), never of a linked one:
  the cleanup of the delivered worktrees takes their `.frontlights` records with them, and the summary comes
  days later. A `candidates.json` lists each print:
  `[{"file": "<image in this folder>", "caption": "<one plain sentence in Portuguese>", "issue": <slice>,
  "cover": <delivery>, "repository": "<OWNER/REPOSITORY>", "takenAt": "<ISO 8601 instant with its offset>", "head": "<DEPOIS head>",
  "visibleFiles": {"<visible file>": "<git blob id>"}}]`.
  `issue` is the slice the print shows; `cover` is the top-level issue of its family (the issue itself when it
  has no parent), the one the summary lists as the delivery; `visibleFiles` maps each visible file of the
  slice (the `by_root` of `browser-gate`) to its Git blob id as served in DEPOIS, so the summary can tell
  whether the code the print shows is still the code that was delivered. Write `candidates.json` from
  scratch on each run of the watched test and keep only what DEPOIS just produced.
- **Never sent from here.** These files stay in the project's `.frontlights` folder, which is never
  committed. They go to the synced summary folder only when the user chooses them in the summary step.
